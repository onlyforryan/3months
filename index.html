                    <p>Ryan, hihihi. Acknowledgement for you, this web you are seeing right now, it‚Äôs my product, 100% coding by my hands, the envelope, 
                      everything made by me, no pictures (just our pictures together). 
                      <br>
                      <br>Yeppp, this is my first time write a letter for somebody, kinda shy ^^. To be honest, I dont know what to say. But I would like to thank you for the time you have been with me, 
                      I really reallyyy enjoy the time Im with you. I know that Im kinda a person have some problems in my life, I never shared it to anyone, but I dont know why I can share it to you (still considered should I share with you sometimes but I still done it). 
                      So, I just want to let you know how much you important for me now. Im not really a good person sometimes, angry, mad person for no reason (but you never cared), also sometimes can not know what Im feelling, I know you sometimes tired of me. But you, you so kinddd, so smart (technically know almost everything),
                      sometimes ‚Äústupid‚Äù, but really stubborn, and passionate with everything about us, 
                      but I like it, just sometimes you made me really madddd, but I think you dont know. 
                      <br>
                      <br>3 months, I think it‚Äôs not too much time together, but Im appreciate the time we have been together. Because Im kinda scare, when I backed to Vietnam, you will forget me, or you bored at me :(( . So I just want to enjoy the time when we can been together, love our quality timeeee. 
                      I remembered the first time we met, go to Ngon, to Southbank, when you took me to museums, to restaurants, to Gold Coast, met your parents, your cousins, your friends. I really appreciate it, because you are the first one done that to me, so I really ‚Ä¶ it :(( . 
                      So I just hope that we can been together longggg more more moreeeee as much as we can.
                      <br>
                      <br>That‚Äôs all, it‚Äôs a bit cheesy, when I wrote it, I cant believe that‚Äôs me :))) . So yeahhh, hope you like my gift, aesop. Because I know that you really like aesop but you dont want to buy it, cause expensive (hope you like it). But doesnt matter, your sugar daddy heree, just useee it, you got me. 
                      And I built the web base on your red (fav colors), and the font like your hand written. 
                      Yayy, also so excited for Brisbane riverfire, and cruise in Decemberr!!!!
